# movie_conversation_searcher
Have you ever remembered a certain sentence or word from a movie that you cant remember its name, or anything about?

well it happened to me, and google serach of the centaence that keept repeating in my mind didnt give me results i wanted.
So i gave my self a challenge to build a site that you could serach for a sentence you remember for a movie and get the name of the movie as a result.
